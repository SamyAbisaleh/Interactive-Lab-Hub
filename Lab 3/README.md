## Part A. Actuating DC motors
* Not asked to display anything here

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors
### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard
**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**
Red is 5V, Brown is Ground, and the Signal Pin is Yellow.

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino
**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**
* The code "sweep" attaches the servo on Arduino Pin 9. Using the code: myservo.attach(9).

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**
* Angle is controlled by the integer position. If Position is 180 that means the servo is at 180 degrees. If it is at 90 it is at 90 degrees. On the other hand speed can be controlled in two different ways. If you change the amount in which the position is increasing or decreasing, the speed will be increased. Furthermore, decreasing the delay time will also increase the speed. 

## Part C. Integrating input and output
* I made the servo motor rotate in relationship to the potentiometer. I did so by mapping the analog input of the potentiometer to the vale

## Part D. Autonomy!
**Include a photo/movie of your autonomous device in action.**

## Part E. Paper display
**a. Make a video of your paper display in action.**

## Part F. Make it your own

Now modify this set up to make this your own design. 

Use paper to build a paper template. Use an Olfa knifes to cut out your pattern, and glue or tape to put it together. <!--If you'd like to use the paper cutter, [here's how](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/How-to-use-the-Silhouette-Cameo-Cutter).-->

You can create a game, you can enact a pre-programmed mini puppet show, or you can visualize data in a new way.

<!--If your design involves having someone controlling the puppet in real time (e.g. using sensors), please film that happening. Otherwise, film the puppet performing it's moves. -->

**a. Make a video of your final design in action.**
