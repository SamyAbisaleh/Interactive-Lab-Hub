# Rotating TV -- Activates and Deactivates with Hand Gestures, follows using facial recognition.

My parents recently installed a TV in the Kitchen. The issue with this TV is that if you want to watch it or move it you have to stop what you are doing to go adjust it. Imagine yourself in a world where instead of having to personally move the TV you could have the TV follow you around. 

I am planning to do this with multiple different objects. The first is a belt and pulley system, to rotate the TV left and right. The second is a Pi Camera. Ideally I want to set up the Pi Camera to read multiple aspects. The first is to read an individuals hand using open CV and follow peoples faces. Or just people in general as they move around. 

To do this I am purchasing a window motor: https://www.robotshop.com/en/power-window-motor-with-coupling-right.html which will allow me to tug on the belt in either direction and have the TV follow. The second is a PiCamera which I have already purchased, and is already here. The third is a belt: https://www.robotshop.com/en/85-tooth-timing-belt.html

Somethings I am unsure of is the capability of the Pi to handle the work and whether or not I would be able to process data from my computer and send it to the Pi to increase the speed of proceesing. Some potential issues that I see coming up are mounting the motor, and getting all the processes with the PiCamera to work properly. In other words, how is the Pi going to process all the information, and can it communicate with the computer via the cloud.
